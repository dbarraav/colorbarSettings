# CC3D simulation to check best resolution for images

Simulation saves 4 types of screenshots for cell-level scalar fields:
1. field1_600x600 - Resolution of 600 x 600 
1. field1_1200x600 - Resolution of 1200 x 600 
1. field1_750x600 - Resolution of 750 x 600 
1. field1_1200x600 - Resolution of 1200 x 1200
